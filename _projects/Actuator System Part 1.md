We had to design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height given a 150 cm x 50 cm 2D space, an actuator of my choice, a rigid bar and 3 pins. I decided to make a pinned beam design that is powered by a pinned actuator. The two are connect by a pin. This image shows the beam in two configurations – the actuator retracted and extended.
